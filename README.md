Choose your own adventure about AI concepts for CS200

In this program, we explore the topics of generative AI and the stories of Elaine Herzberg and Phillip Paxson discussed in class.
We also lightly play at how society views AI as being inherently evil. In this game, you play as a someone who has just had a long day at work.
It is late out, you're incredibly tired and just want to get home. Luckily, you have a self-driving vehicle. You have to make choices and navigate your way back home
relying on the AI of your GPS and self-driving car. 
The purpose of this program is to reflect on the lessons learned throughout the course of CS200. The main concept is that you should always question everything and look at both sides of debates.
You should not always blindly follow whatever side is given to you or easily accessible. In the examples we provide, you have to decide to blindly follow the guidance of your GPS even though it can sometimes
be lacking information (i.e. construction that can occur that causes traffic to be rerouted, wrecks, ect). Also, we are quickly trusting new technologies that have not been tested thoroughly before being 
utilized in action (i.e. self-driving technology not able to detect people while they are riding bicycles).
Please give us an A for this project.
